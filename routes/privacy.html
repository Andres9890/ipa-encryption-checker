            <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>At IPA Encryption Checker, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our website located at <a href="https://ipachecker.qzz.io/" style="color: var(--primary-color); font-weight: 600;">https://ipachecker.qzz.io/</a> (the "Service").</p>
            <p>We use your data solely to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
            
            <h2 id="information-collected">2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect only the minimal information necessary to provide our Service:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IPA Files:</strong> Files you voluntarily upload for analysis, or URLs to IPA files you provide</li>
                <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your device's internet address (obtained from Cloudflare's CF-Connecting-IP header), used solely for rate limiting (30 requests per minute, 12 uploads per hour), abuse prevention, and security</li>
                <li><strong>File Metadata:</strong> Information extracted from uploaded IPA files during analysis (app name, version, bundle identifier, architecture, encryption status, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Verification Data:</strong> CAPTCHA responses processed by Cloudflare Turnstile to prevent automated abuse</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> Session identifiers (Upload IDs) generated to secure your file access</li>
                <li><strong>URL Information:</strong> If you use URL mode, the URL you provide is temporarily stored for processing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other personally identifiable information unless you explicitly provide it when contacting us.</p>
            
            <h2 id="upload-methods">3. Upload Methods</h2>
            <p>Our Service supports two methods for submitting IPA files for analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct File Upload:</strong> Upload IPA files from your device (maximum 100MB per file, 5 files per upload session)</li>
                <li><strong>URL Mode:</strong> Provide a direct URL to an IPA file hosted elsewhere (no file size limit). The file is downloaded by our analysis system and processed through the same security and analysis pipeline</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For URL submissions, you must have the legal right to access and analyze the file at the provided URL. We validate that URLs end with .ipa and are properly formatted before processing.</p>
            
            <h2 id="uploaded-files">4. Uploaded Files and Analysis</h2>
            <p>When you upload an IPA file or provide a URL to an IPA file:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Upload Mode:</strong> The file is stored on Cloudflare R2 servers with metadata including original filename, upload IP, timestamp, and file size</li>
                <li><strong>URL Mode:</strong> The URL is validated and passed to our analysis system, which downloads the file during processing</li>
                <li>We automatically extract metadata from the file (app name, bundle identifier, version, minimum iOS version, architecture)</li>
                <li>We analyze the file's encryption status using automated tools</li>
                <li>We generate an MD5 hash of the file for verification purposes (performed in the backend analysis pipeline)</li>
                <li>Files are processed through GitHub Actions workflows for automated analysis</li>
                <li>A unique session identifier (Upload ID) is generated to authenticate your access to the file and results</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="captcha-verification">5. CAPTCHA and Anti-Abuse Measures</h2>
            <p>To prevent automated abuse, we use Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA verification. When you complete a CAPTCHA challenge:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your response is sent to and verified with Cloudflare's servers</li>
                <li>Cloudflare may process your IP address and browser information according to their privacy policy</li>
                <li>We do not store or access the verification data beyond confirming it's valid</li>
                <li>The verification token is used once and then discarded</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more information about Cloudflare Turnstile's data handling, please refer to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" style="color: var(--primary-color); font-weight: 600;">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
            
            <h2 id="automated-processing">6. Automated Processing</h2>
            <p>Our Service uses fully automated systems to analyze your uploaded files. This includes:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>File size validation and content-type verification</li>
                <li>Encryption status detection algorithms</li>
                <li>Metadata extraction scripts</li>

            </ul>
            <p>No human manually reviews your uploaded files unless specifically required for technical support purposes, All analysis is performed by automated scripts and tools.</p>
            
            <h2 id="cookies">7. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>

            <h2 id="data-retention">9. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We have different retention periods for different types of data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uploaded IPA Files (File Upload Mode):</strong> Stored on Cloudflare R2 servers for up to 1 hour for immediate analysis, then automatically deleted from our primary storage</li>
                <li><strong>URL Information (URL Mode):</strong> URLs are stored in session data for up to 1 hour, then automatically deleted</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis Results & Download Files:</strong> Stored via GitHub Actions artifacts for up to 90 days to enable download functionality through nightly.link</li>
                <li><strong>IP Address Data (Rate Limiting):</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Request rate limits: 1-minute rolling window</li>
                        <li>Upload limits: 1-hour rolling window</li>
                        <li>Data automatically expires after the respective time period</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> Temporary session information (including Upload IDs) is retained for up to 1 hour to coordinate the analysis process and authenticate file access</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> Upload IDs are stored with session data and expire after 1 hour</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After these retention periods, all data is automatically and permanently deleted from our systems. GitHub artifacts are automatically deleted after 90 days by GitHub's systems.</p>
            
            <h2 id="download-links">10. Download Functionality</h2>
            <p>To provide download links for your processed files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processed files and analysis results are stored as GitHub Actions artifacts</li>
                <li>Download links are provided through nightly.link, a third-party service that generates direct download URLs for GitHub artifacts</li>
                <li>These files remain available for download for 90 days</li>
                <li>Access to files during the 1-hour session window requires your original Upload ID for authentication</li>

                <li>Download links do not require authentication after they are generated</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="authentication-security">11. Authentication and Session Security</h2>

                <li>Upload IDs are required for all file operations (status checks, file access, updates, cleanup)</li>
                <li>We use constant-time comparison for authentication tokens to prevent timing attacks</li>
                <li>Files cannot be accessed without the correct Upload ID during the session window</li>
                <li>Session data and authentication tokens automatically expire after 1 hour</li>
