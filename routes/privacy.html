            <h2 id="information-collected">2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>When you use our Service, we only collect information from the IPA files you voluntarily upload for analysis. We do not collect any personal information or usage data from our users.</p>
            
            <h2 id="uploaded-files">3. Uploaded Files</h2>
            <p>Our primary function is to analyze IPA files that you upload to our Service. When you upload an IPA file:</p>

                <li>We extract metadata from the file (such as app name, bundle identifier, version, etc.)</li>
                <li>We analyze the file's encryption status</li>
                <li>We generate an MD5 hash of the file</li>
                <li>All files are automatically deleted after analysis is complete or within 24 hours, whichever comes first</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="usage-data">4. Usage Data</h2>
            <p>We do not collect any usage data or technical information when you visit our website. We do not track:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IP addresses</li>
                <li>Browser information</li>
